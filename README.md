Binary trees Project

TASKS:

1. Write a function that creates a binary tree node

2. Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node

	Prototype: binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_left(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);

3. Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node

4. Write a function that deletes an entire binary tree

5. Write a function that checks if a node is a leaf

	Prototype: int binary_tree_is_leaf(const binary_tree_t *node);

6. Write a function that checks if a given node is a root

7. Write a function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal

8. Write a function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal

9. Write a function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal

10. Write a function that measures the height of a binary tree

11. Write a function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree

12. Write a function that measures the size of a binary tree

13. Write a function that counts the leaves in a binary tree

14. Write a function that counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree

15. Write a function that measures the balance factor of a binary tree

16. Write a function that checks if a binary tree is full
